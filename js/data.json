		"<p>Nice to meet you, I'm Edgar! I was born and raised in SoCal, a first generation college student, and former NCAA finalist. After receiving my Bachelor's in Applied Math, I went on to pursue a Masters of Engineering degree in Renewable Energy Systems. I've recently graduated from App Academy, one of the most rigorous coding bootcamps in the nation, and am eagerly looking to enter the workforce as a software engineer.</p>,",
		"<p>Prior to my enrollment at A/A, I worked in the aerospace industry as a Quality Assurance engineer for Collins Aerospace (now merged with Raytheon Technologies). I explored a budding interest in coding through Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Many of the daily workflows in the QA department, both for the engineers and the people on the manufacturing floor, were highly repetitive. It was frustrating seeing my coworkers have to spend so much time on menial tasks, so I took this opportunity to use Excel macros to automate their tasks. Seeing the satisfaction on my peers' faces after using my macros for the first time felt so gratifying, and it's one of the many events that eventually lead me to A/A.</p>",
		"<p>Now, I'm looking to making coding my full time passion. This is only a small part of my story, and I'd be more than happy to share the whole picture. Feel free to message me through any of the provided links at the bottom of this page. Enjoy your stay!</p>"
